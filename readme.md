This repo contains the programs and results of my master thesis for Levy Economics institute. Raw data is not updated due to their sizes. 

Work journal:
9/13/2025: 6 hours; I got familiar with the data. \n
9/14/2025: 6 hours; I tested the data for homebuilders but gave up because data was scarse and the argument wasn't clear. \n
9/15/2025: 5 hours; I formulated the thesis for E&P firms in the energy sector, collected data, and finished cleaning. \n
9/18/2025: 7 hours; I spent a lot of time doing data cleaning and regressions but the result is not promising. The accounting for E&P firm is quite special as the exploration cost sometimes is included in cost of goods sold and the data for exploration expense is not good. Considering finding another story.
